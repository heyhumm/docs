description: Learn how to authenticate API requests using personal access tokens

## Overview

All Humm API requests require authentication using a personal access token (PAT). These tokens allow you to securely access the Config, Analyst, and Billing APIs.

## Creating a Personal Access Token

1. Log in to your Humm account at [app.heyhumm.ai](https://app.heyhumm.ai)
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **API Tokens**
3. Click **Create New Token**
4. Give your token a descriptive name
5. Copy the token immediately - you won't be able to see it again

<Warning>
Store your personal access token securely. Anyone with access to your token can make API requests on your behalf.
</Warning>

## Using Your Token

Include your personal access token in the `Authorization` header of every API request:

```bash
curl https://config.heyhumm.ai/api/v1/endpoint \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl https://analyst.heyhumm.ai/api/v1/queries \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer pat_1234567890abcdef" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Token Security Best Practices

- **Never commit tokens to version control** - Use environment variables instead
- **Rotate tokens regularly** - Create new tokens and delete old ones periodically
- **Use separate tokens per application** - This makes it easier to revoke access if needed
- **Delete unused tokens** - Remove tokens that are no longer in use

## Rate Limiting

API requests are rate limited to ensure service stability. If you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. Check the response headers for rate limit information:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit` - Maximum requests allowed per time window
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining` - Requests remaining in current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset` - Time when the rate limit resets (Unix timestamp)
