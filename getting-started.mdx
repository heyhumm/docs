description: Get up and running with Humm in minutes—no technical skills required.
---

## Before You Begin

To get started with Humm, you'll need:

- An invitation to your organization's Humm workspace (check your email)
- Login credentials (usually your company SSO)
- A data source to connect (your admin may have already set this up)

<Note>
If you're not sure whether your organization has Humm set up, reach out to your manager or IT team.
</Note>

## Step 1: Log In to Humm

1. Go to [app.heyhumm.ai](https://app.heyhumm.ai/)
2. Click **Log In** and sign in with your company credentials (SSO)
3. You should see your organization name in the bottom left corner

If you're joining an existing team, you'll likely see integrations and threads that others have already created. Feel free to explore!

## Step 2: Connect Your Data

Before Humm can answer questions, it needs access to your data. If your admin hasn't already set up integrations, here's how to add one:

    width="100%"
    height="400"
    frameBorder="0"
    allowFullScreen
  />
</Frame>

1. Click **Integrations** in the sidebar
2. Click **Browse Catalog** to see available data sources
3. Select the integration you want (e.g., Snowflake, HubSpot, Salesforce)
4. Fill out the connection details and click **Save**
5. Click the **Introspect Schema** button to let Humm learn your data structure

<Tip>
Start with your most important data source—usually your data warehouse (Snowflake, BigQuery) or CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot). You can always add more integrations later.
</Tip>

After a few minutes, Humm will understand your data and be ready to answer questions.

## Step 3: Ask Your First Question

Now for the fun part—asking Humm a question.

    frameBorder="0"
    allowFullScreen
  />
</Frame>

1. Click the **+ New** button in the top left to start a new thread
2. Type a question in plain English
3. Press **Send** and watch Humm work

### Questions to try

Not sure what to ask? Here are some ideas to get you started:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Account Health">
    - "Which of my accounts are at risk of churning?"
    - "Show me accounts with declining product usage this month"
    - "What's the health status of [Account Name]?"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Meeting Prep">
    - "Prepare a QBR summary for [Account Name]"
    - "What should I know before my call with [Account Name]?"
    - "Show me recent support tickets for [Account Name]"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Portfolio Overview">
    - "How is my book of business performing this quarter?"
    - "Which accounts have upcoming renewals?"
    - "Show me my largest accounts by ARR"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## Step 4: Dig Deeper with Follow-ups

Humm remembers the context of your conversation. After getting an initial answer, ask follow-up questions to explore further:

- "Why is their usage declining?"
- "Show me this as a chart"
- "What actions should I take?"
- "Compare this to last quarter"

Each thread saves your full conversation, so you can come back to it anytime.
