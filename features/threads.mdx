description: Have conversations with Humm to explore your data and get answers.

Threads are conversations with Humm. Each thread is a back-and-forth dialogue where you ask questions in plain English and Humm provides answers with data, charts, and recommendations.

## Starting a Thread

Click **New Thread** from the sidebar to start a conversation. Type your question in the message box—no special syntax or query language needed.

**Example questions to get started:**
- "Which accounts have the highest churn risk?"
- "Show me product usage trends for Acme Corp"
- "What's our average NPS score by customer segment?"

## Understanding Humm's Response

When you ask a question, Humm shows you two things:

### Reasoning

The reasoning section shows how Humm is thinking through your question. You'll see which data sources it's querying, what calculations it's running, and how it's arriving at the answer. This transparency helps you trust the results and catch any misunderstandings early.

### Answer

The answer section contains Humm's response, which may include:
- **Text explanations** — Context and insights about what the data shows
- **Charts and visualizations** — Graphs that make patterns easy to spot
- **Data tables** — The underlying numbers you can explore
- **Recommendations** — Suggested next steps based on the analysis

## Asking Follow-Up Questions

The real power of threads comes from follow-up questions. After Humm answers, you can dig deeper:

- "Break this down by region"
- "Why did churn spike in Q3?"
- "Show me the accounts driving this number"
- "Compare this to last quarter"

Humm remembers the context of your conversation, so you don't need to repeat yourself.

## Managing Threads

### Finding Past Threads

All your threads are saved automatically. Use the sidebar to browse past conversations, or search by keyword to find a specific analysis.

### Sharing Threads

Share a thread with teammates by clicking the **Share** button. Recipients can view the full conversation and continue asking their own questions.

### Organizing Threads

Pin important threads to keep them at the top of your list. You can also rename threads to make them easier to find later.

## Tips for Better Results

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be specific about what you want">
    Instead of "Show me churn data," try "Show me accounts that churned in the last 90 days with ARR over $50k."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mention the timeframe">
    Humm defaults to reasonable timeframes, but specifying "last quarter" or "year over year" gets you exactly what you need.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Ask for comparisons">
    Questions like "How does this compare to last month?" or "Which segment is performing best?" often reveal the most useful insights.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Request specific formats">
    If you want a chart, table, or list, just ask. "Show me a trend chart of monthly active users" or "Give me a table of at-risk accounts."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## When to Start a New Thread

Start a new thread when you're switching to a completely different topic. If you're still exploring the same general area—even if you're asking different questions—keep going in the same thread. The context helps Humm give better answers.
