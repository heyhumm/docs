title: Scheduled Commands
description: Automate report generation by running saved commands on a regular schedule.
---

Scheduled Commands let you automate your recurring analyses. Instead of manually running the same command each week or month, schedule it once and Humm will run it automatically—delivering results straight to your inbox and your team's.

## Why Use Scheduled Commands?

Many reports need to run on a regular basis:
- Weekly revenue and pipeline summaries
- Daily active user metrics
- Monthly customer health reviews
- End-of-week team performance reports

Without scheduling, you'd need to remember to run these reports manually. With Scheduled Commands, you configure it once and receive results automatically.

## Creating a Schedule

Before you can schedule a command, make sure you have a saved command ready to go.

### Steps to Schedule

1. Navigate to your saved command in **Commands**
2. Click the **Schedule** button (calendar icon)
3. Configure your schedule:
   - **Cadence** — Daily, weekly, weekdays, or monthly
   - **Run Mode** — Per Subscriber or Once & Distribute
   - **Run Time** — When the report should execute
   - **Timezone** — Your preferred timezone
   - **Enabled** — Toggle to activate
4. Click **Create Schedule**

You'll automatically be subscribed to receive the reports.

### Schedule Options

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cadence">
    Choose how often your report runs:
    - **Daily** — Runs every day at the specified time
    - **Weekly** — Runs every Monday at the specified time
    - **Weekdays** — Runs Monday through Friday at the specified time
    - **Monthly** — Runs on the 1st of each month
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Timezone Support">
    Pick from multiple timezones including Eastern, Central, Mountain, Pacific, UTC, London, and Central European time. Timezones that observe daylight saving automatically adjust, so your reports always run at the expected local time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Run Time">
    Select the exact time for execution. Consider your team's workflow:
    - **Morning (8-10 AM)** — Start the day with fresh insights
    - **End of day (4-6 PM)** — Daily summaries before close
    - **Overnight (2-4 AM)** — Process heavy queries during off-peak hours
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Run Mode">
    Choose how the scheduled command executes and distributes results:
    - **Per Subscriber** — Runs the command once for each subscriber in their user context. Each subscriber receives personalized results based on their data access permissions.
    - **Once & Distribute** — Runs the command once and distributes the same results to all subscribers. Ideal for organization-wide reports where everyone should see identical data.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Managing Subscribers

After creating a schedule, you can add team members to receive the same reports.

2. Click **Add** in the Subscribers section

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I schedule a command multiple times per day?">

  </Accordion>
