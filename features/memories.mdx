description: Help Humm learn your business context for more accurate answers.

Memories are how Humm learns and improves over time. As you use Humm, it captures important knowledge from your conversations—business definitions, data relationships, and organizational context that make future answers more accurate.

## How Memories Work

When you interact with Humm, it listens for information that might be useful later:

- **Business definitions** — What terms mean in your organization
- **Data relationships** — How different systems connect
- **Preferences** — How you like information presented
- **Corrections** — Feedback when something was wrong

Humm proposes new Memories based on your conversations. You review and approve them before they take effect, so you stay in control of what Humm learns.

## Examples of Memories

  <Card title="Business Definitions">
    "Enterprise accounts are those with ARR over $100k"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Data Relationships">
    "The account_id field in HubSpot maps to external_id in Snowflake"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Metric Calculations">
    "Health score is calculated as 40% product usage + 30% support tickets + 30% engagement"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Organizational Context">
    "Sarah owns the West region accounts, Marcus owns East"
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Reviewing Memories

When Humm proposes a new Memory, you'll see it in your **Memories** section with a "Pending Review" status.

For each proposed Memory, you can:
- **Approve** — The Memory becomes active and Humm will use it going forward
- **Edit** — Adjust the wording before approving
- **Reject** — Discard the Memory if it's not useful or accurate

Take a moment to review pending Memories regularly. The more accurate Memories Humm has, the better your answers will be.

## Managing Memories

### Viewing Active Memories

Click **Memories** in the sidebar to see everything Humm has learned. Memories are organized by category:

- **Definitions** — Business terms and their meanings
- **Relationships** — How data connects across systems
- **Preferences** — Your formatting and presentation preferences
- **Context** — Organizational and process information

### Editing Memories

Click any Memory to edit it. You might update a Memory when:
- A business definition changes
- You find a more accurate way to express something
- The original wording was slightly off

Changes take effect immediately for all future conversations.

### Deleting Memories

If a Memory is outdated or incorrect, click it and select **Delete**. Humm will stop using that information right away.

## Teaching Humm Directly

You don't have to wait for Humm to propose Memories. You can teach Humm directly in any conversation:

- "Remember that we call accounts 'at risk' when their health score drops below 60"
- "Note that our fiscal year starts in February"
- "Keep in mind that the sales team uses 'MQL' to mean Marketing Qualified Lead"

Humm will create a Memory from your instruction. You'll still see it in your Memories list where you can review or edit it.

## Team vs. Personal Memories

Memories can be scoped to you personally or shared across your team:

- **Personal Memories** — Apply only to your conversations
- **Team Memories** — Apply to everyone on your team

Most business definitions and data relationships should be Team Memories so everyone benefits. Personal Memories work well for individual preferences.

## Tips for Better Memories

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be specific and precise">
    "Enterprise accounts have ARR over $100k" is better than "Enterprise accounts are big accounts."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Correct mistakes immediately">
    If Humm gets something wrong, tell it. "Actually, that's not right—health score doesn't include NPS." This creates a Memory that prevents the same mistake.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review regularly">
    Check your Memories every few weeks. Business definitions change, and keeping Memories current keeps answers accurate.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Share with your team">
    When you teach Humm something useful, consider making it a Team Memory so everyone benefits from the knowledge.
