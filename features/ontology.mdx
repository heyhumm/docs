description: Humm's understanding of your business entities and relationships.
---

The ontology is Humm's map of your business. It defines the key entities in your world—like Customers, Accounts, and Products—and how they relate to each other. A well-defined ontology helps Humm understand your questions and return accurate answers.

## What's in the Ontology?

### Entities

Entities are the core concepts in your business. Common examples:

- **Account** — A company or organization you do business with
- **Contact** — A person associated with an account
- **Opportunity** — A potential deal or sale
- **Subscription** — A recurring revenue relationship
- **User** — Someone who uses your product
- **Event** — An action or activity in your product

Each entity has attributes (like name, created date, or status) that describe it.

### Relationships

Relationships define how entities connect:

- Accounts **have** Contacts
- Accounts **have** Subscriptions
- Users **belong to** Accounts
- Users **generate** Events
- Opportunities **convert to** Subscriptions

These relationships let Humm navigate your data and answer questions that span multiple systems.

### Metrics

Metrics are the key performance indicators you track:

- **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)** — Revenue from subscriptions
- **Churn Rate** — Percentage of customers who cancel
- **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** — Customer satisfaction measure
- **Health Score** — Overall account health indicator

Humm uses metric definitions to calculate values consistently across your analyses.

## How Humm Builds the Ontology

When you connect integrations, Humm automatically discovers your data structure:

1. **Schema discovery** — Humm reads your tables, fields, and data types
2. **Entity detection** — Humm identifies business entities from your data
3. **Relationship inference** — Humm detects how entities connect based on keys and patterns
4. **Metric recognition** — Humm identifies common metrics and calculations

This automatic process gives you a working ontology immediately. You can then refine it to match exactly how your team thinks about the business.

## Viewing the Ontology

Click **Ontology** in the sidebar to explore Humm's understanding of your business. You'll see:

- **Entity list** — All recognized entities and their attributes
- **Relationship map** — Visual diagram of how entities connect
- **Metric definitions** — How key metrics are calculated
- **Data sources** — Which integrations power each entity

## Refining the Ontology

The automatic ontology is a starting point. Refine it to improve accuracy:

### Renaming Entities

If Humm calls something "Company" but your team says "Account," rename it. Humm will understand both terms, but using your team's language makes conversations more natural.

### Adding Relationships

If Humm missed a connection between entities, add it manually. For example, if your product data links to accounts through a custom field, define that relationship so Humm can traverse it.

### Defining Metrics

Add your specific metric calculations. If your health score formula is unique to your business, define it in the ontology so Humm calculates it correctly every time.

### Adding Business Context

Enrich entities with descriptions and examples:

- "Churned accounts are those with status = 'cancelled' and no active subscription"
- "Enterprise tier includes Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans"

This context helps Humm interpret your questions accurately.

## Ontology and Accuracy

The ontology directly affects answer quality:

| Ontology Quality | Result |
|-----------------|--------|
| **Minimal** | Humm can answer basic questions but may miss nuances |
| **Good** | Humm understands your terminology and key relationships |
| **Excellent** | Humm reasons about your business like a team member |

Investing time in your ontology pays off in every conversation.

## Tips for a Better Ontology

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use your team's language">
    Name entities and metrics the way your team talks about them. If everyone says "ARR" not "Annual Recurring Revenue," use "ARR."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Define edge cases">
    Clarify ambiguous situations: "An active account is one with at least one paying subscription, excluding trials."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Connect all your data">
    The ontology works best when all your integrations are linked. Make sure Humm knows how to join data across systems.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Revisit periodically">
    As your business evolves, so should your ontology. Review it quarterly to add new entities, metrics, or relationships.
