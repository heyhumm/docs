description: Save and reuse prompts to automate repetitive analyses.
---

Commands are reusable prompts that save you time on repetitive work. Instead of typing out the same detailed question each time, create a Command once and run it whenever you need it.

## Why Use Commands?

Many analyses follow the same pattern:
- Preparing for a QBR with a specific account
- Running weekly portfolio health checks
- Assessing churn risk for renewal accounts
- Generating onboarding status reports

Without Commands, you'd type out (or copy-paste) the same detailed prompt every time. With Commands, you save the prompt once and run it with a single click.

## Creating a Command

1. Click **Commands** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Command**
3. Give your Command a name (e.g., "QBR Prep")
4. Write the prompt you want to reuse
5. Add any variables for dynamic content (optional)
6. Click **Save**

### Using Variables

Variables let you customize a Command each time you run it. Wrap variable names in double curly braces:

```
Prepare a QBR summary for {{account_name}} including:
- Health score trends over the last 6 months
- Product usage highlights
- Open support tickets
- Expansion opportunities
```

When you run this Command, Humm will ask you to fill in `account_name` before executing.

## Running a Command

1. Click **Commands** in the sidebar
2. Find the Command you want to run
3. Click **Run**
4. Fill in any variables if prompted
5. Humm creates a new thread with the Command's prompt

The result is a regular thread, so you can ask follow-up questions and dig deeper.

## Sharing Commands

Commands can be personal or shared with your team:

- **Personal Commands** — Only you can see and run them
- **Team Commands** — Anyone on your team can use them

To share a Command, open it and click **Share with Team**. Shared Commands appear in everyone's Command library.

## Editing and Deleting Commands

Open any Command to edit its name, prompt, or variables. Changes apply immediately—the next time anyone runs the Command, they'll get the updated version.

To delete a Command, open it and click **Delete**. Deleted Commands can't be recovered, so make sure you don't need it anymore.

## Tips for Effective Commands

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be detailed in your prompts">
    Commands work best when the prompt is specific. Include exactly what sections, metrics, and format you want in the output.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use clear variable names">
    Name variables descriptively: `{{account_name}}` is clearer than `{{x}}`. This helps when running the Command later.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test before sharing">
    Run your Command a few times with different inputs to make sure it produces good results before sharing with your team.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Start from a successful thread">
    If you asked a great question in a thread and want to reuse it, copy the prompt into a new Command. You already know it works.
