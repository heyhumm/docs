description: How to generate and configure service account credentials for BigQuery integrations.
---

## 1. Create a Service Account

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Select your project from the dropdown
3. Navigate to **IAM & Admin** > **Service Accounts**
4. Click **Create Service Account**
5. Enter a name (e.g., `humm-bigquery`) and description
6. Click **Create and Continue**

## 2. Grant Required Permissions

Assign one of the following roles to the service account:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `BigQuery Data Viewer` | Read-only access to tables and views |
| `BigQuery Data Editor` | Read and write access to tables and views |
| `BigQuery Job User` | Required to run queries |

At minimum, Humm needs **BigQuery Data Viewer** and **BigQuery Job User** to query your data.

Click **Continue**, then **Done**.

## 3. Generate a JSON Key

1. From the Service Accounts list, click on your new service account
2. Go to the **Keys** tab
3. Click **Add Key** > **Create new key**
4. Select **JSON** as the key type
5. Click **Create**

The JSON key file downloads automatically to your computer.

<Warning>
Store this key file securely. Do **not** commit it to git or share it publicly. This file grants access to your BigQuery data.
</Warning>

## 4. Verify the Key File

The downloaded JSON file should contain these fields:

```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "your-project-id",
  "private_key_id": "...",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "humm-bigquery@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "...",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  ...
}
```

## 5. Upload the Credentials to Humm

1. Log into Humm and create a BigQuery integration
2. Upload the JSON key file
3. Humm will automatically extract the project ID and credentials
