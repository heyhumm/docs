## Filter Parameters

Most Gong tools accept a `filter` parameter to scope results. Common filter options:

```json
// Filter by date range
{
  "filter": {
    "fromDateTime": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "toDateTime": "2025-01-31T23:59:59Z"
  }
}

// Filter by specific call IDs
{
  "filter": {
    "callIds": ["7782342274025937895", "7782342274025937896"]
  }
}

// Filter by call owner (GONG_LIST_DETAILED_CALLS only)
{
  "filter": {
    "fromDateTime": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "toDateTime": "2025-01-31T23:59:59Z",
    "primaryUserIds": ["234599484848423"]
