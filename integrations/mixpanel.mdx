## JQL Query Examples

Humm can execute JQL (JavaScript Query Language) queries against Mixpanel's Query API. Here are common patterns:

```javascript
// Get events from the last 7 days
function main() {
  return Events({
    from_date: '2024-01-01',
    to_date: '2024-01-07'
  });
}

// Filter events by name
function main() {
  return Events({
    from_date: '2024-01-01',
    to_date: '2024-01-07'
  }).filter(function(event) {
    return event.name == 'Purchase';
  });
}

// Group by property
function main() {
  return Events({
    from_date: '2024-01-01',
    to_date: '2024-01-07'
  }).groupBy(['properties.plan_type'], mixpanel.reducer.count());
}
```

## Query Constraints

JQL queries have the following limits:

- 60 queries per hour rate limit
- Maximum 5 concurrent queries
- 2-minute execution timeout
- 5 GB data processing limit
