PostHog is the open-source product analytics platform that helps engineers build better products. Connect Humm to query events, analyze user behavior, and explore your product data.

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `POSTHOG_CREATE_QUERY_IN_PROJECT_BY_ID` | Execute HogQL queries against your PostHog project |
| `POSTHOG_LIST_USERS` | List users with project membership details |

## HogQL Query Examples

Humm uses HogQL, PostHog's SQL-like query language, to query your analytics data. Here are common patterns:

```sql
# Recent events
SELECT * FROM events ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 100

# Events by type in the last 7 days
SELECT event, count() as count
FROM events
WHERE timestamp > now() - interval 7 day
GROUP BY event
ORDER BY count DESC

# Unique users by event
SELECT event, uniq(distinct_id) as unique_users
FROM events
GROUP BY event
ORDER BY unique_users DESC

# Page views with properties
SELECT properties.$current_url as url, count() as views
FROM events
WHERE event = '$pageview'
GROUP BY url
ORDER BY views DESC
LIMIT 20

# User journey analysis
SELECT distinct_id, event, timestamp
FROM events
WHERE distinct_id = 'user-id-here'
ORDER BY timestamp ASC
```

## User Identification

The `POSTHOG_LIST_USERS` tool helps identify users in your PostHog organization. Filter by email to find specific users and their project memberships.
