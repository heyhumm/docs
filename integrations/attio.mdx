Attio is the AI-native CRM that builds, scales, and grows your company with powerful and flexible data models. Connect Humm to query people, companies, and deals with advanced filtering and sorting.

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ATTIO_LIST_RECORDS` | List records for an object type (people, companies, deals) with filtering and sorting |
| `ATTIO_READ_RECORD` | Get a record by ID and object type |
| `ATTIO_LIST_WORKSPACE_MEMBERS` | List all members of the Attio workspace |

## Filter and Sort Examples

Humm uses Attio's filter syntax to query records. Here are common patterns:

```
# List all people
object: "people"

# Filter by name
object: "people"
filter: {"name": "Ada Lovelace"}

# Filter with OR conditions
object: "people"
filter: {
  "$or": [
    {"name": {"first_name": {"$eq": "David"}}},
    {"name": {"first_name": {"$eq": "Steve"}}}
  ]
}

# Sort by last name ascending
object: "people"
sorts: [{"direction": "asc", "attribute": "name", "field": "last_name"}]

# Sort by creation date descending
object: "companies"
sorts: [{"direction": "desc", "attribute": "created_at"}]

# Pagination
object: "deals"
limit: 100
offset: 0
```

## Object Types

Attio supports querying different object types:

- **people** - Contact records with names, emails, and custom fields
- **companies** - Organization records with company details
- **deals** - Deal/opportunity records for pipeline tracking

Use the object slug (e.g., `"people"`, `"companies"`, `"deals"`) or UUID to specify which object type to query.
