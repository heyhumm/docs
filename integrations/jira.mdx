Jira is a project management tool that helps teams plan, track, and manage software development. Connect Humm to search issues, discover project structures, and understand your team's work.

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `JIRA_SEARCH_ISSUES_BY_JQL` | Search issues using JQL queries with pagination |
| `JIRA_GET_ISSUE` | Get detailed information about a specific issue |
| `JIRA_GET_ISSUE_COMMENTS` | Get comments on a specific issue |
| `JIRA_LIST_PROJECTS` | List accessible projects |
| `JIRA_LIST_FIELDS` | List all fields including custom fields |
| `JIRA_GET_PROJECT_ISSUE_TYPES` | Get issue types available in a project |
| `JIRA_FIND_USERS` | Search for users by name or email |

## JQL Query Examples

Humm uses JIRA Query Language (JQL) to search issues. Here are common patterns:

```
# Recent bugs in a project
project = PROJ AND issuetype = Bug AND created >= -7d

# Open high priority issues
status = Open AND priority = High ORDER BY created DESC

# My assigned tasks
assignee = currentUser() AND status NOT IN (Done, Closed)

# Unassigned issues
assignee IS EMPTY AND status = Open
```

## Project Access Control

When connecting Jira, you can restrict which projects Humm can access. This is useful for:

- Limiting access to sensitive projects
- Scoping queries to relevant teams
- Ensuring data governance compliance

All searches are automatically scoped to allowed projects. If no project filter is specified in a query, results are limited to configured projects.
