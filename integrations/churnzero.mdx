ChurnZero is a real-time customer success platform that helps subscription businesses fight customer churn. Connect Humm to query accounts, contacts, churn scores, and tasks using the ChurnZero OData API.

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `CHURNZERO_GET_ACCOUNTS` | List accounts with health scores using OData queries |
| `CHURNZERO_GET_ACCOUNT` | Get account details by internal ChurnZero ID |
| `CHURNZERO_GET_ACCOUNT_BY_EXTERNAL_ID` | Get account by your system's external ID |
| `CHURNZERO_GET_CONTACTS` | List contacts with filtering by account or email |
| `CHURNZERO_GET_CHURN_SCORES` | List churn score definitions (names and metadata) |
| `CHURNZERO_GET_CHURN_SCORE_FACTORS` | List factors contributing to churn scores |
| `CHURNZERO_GET_CHURN_SCORE_CALCULATIONS` | Get historical churn score calculations for accounts |
| `CHURNZERO_GET_CHURN_SCORE_FACTOR_CALCULATIONS` | Get detailed calculation logs for churn score factors |
| `CHURNZERO_GET_TASKS` | List tasks and to-dos associated with accounts |
| `CHURNZERO_GET_USER_ACCOUNT` | Get details for a ChurnZero user (CSM, Admin, etc.) |

## OData Query Examples

Humm uses OData v4 query parameters to filter and paginate results. Here are common patterns:

```
# Active accounts with high contract value
$filter=IsActive eq true and TotalContractAmount gt 10000

# Accounts created after a specific date
$filter=ObjectCreatedDate gt 2024-01-01

# Sort by newest first
$orderby=ObjectCreatedDate desc

# Select specific fields only
$select=Id,Name,TotalContractAmount,IsActive

# Contacts for a specific account
$filter=AccountId eq 12345

# Open tasks for an account
$filter=AccountId eq 25322 and isClosed eq false
```

### OData Filter Limitations

ChurnZero's OData implementation has specific constraints:

- **No mixed operators**: Do not combine `and` and `or` in the same filter. Keep filters flat (all-`and` or all-`or`).
- **No ID filtering on list endpoints**: Cannot filter by `Id` or `AccountExternalId` on `/Account`. Use `CHURNZERO_GET_ACCOUNT` or `CHURNZERO_GET_ACCOUNT_BY_EXTERNAL_ID` instead.
- **Limited string functions**: `contains()`, `startswith()`, `endswith()` may not work on all endpoints. Fall back to exact `eq` matches if you get HTTP 400 errors.

### Supported Operators

| Operator | Example |
|----------|---------|
| `eq` | `Name eq 'Acme Corp'` |
| `ne` | `Status ne 'Active'` |
| `gt` | `TotalContractAmount gt 1000` |
| `ge` | `ObjectCreatedDate ge 2024-01-01` |
| `lt` | `TotalContractAmount lt 5000` |
| `le` | `ObjectCreatedDate le 2024-12-31` |
