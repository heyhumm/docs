## SOQL Query Examples

Humm uses Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) to retrieve data. Here are common patterns:

```
# Find a user by email
SELECT Id, Name FROM User WHERE Email = 'user@example.com'

# List accounts with health scores
SELECT Id, Name, Health_Score__c FROM Account WHERE Health_Score__c != null

# Open opportunities closing this quarter
SELECT Id, Name, Amount, CloseDate FROM Opportunity
WHERE StageName != 'Closed Won' AND StageName != 'Closed Lost'
AND CloseDate = THIS_QUARTER

# Contacts at a specific account
SELECT Id, Name, Email, Phone FROM Contact WHERE AccountId = '001XXXXXXXXXXXX'

# Recent leads
SELECT Id, Name, Company, Status FROM Lead
WHERE CreatedDate = LAST_N_DAYS:7 ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC
```
