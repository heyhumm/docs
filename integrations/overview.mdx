description: Connect your data sources so Humm can answer questions about your customers.
---

Integrations connect Humm to the tools and data you already use. Once connected, Humm can pull information from these sources to answer your questions—no manual data exports or spreadsheets required.

<Tip>
The more integrations you connect, the more complete picture Humm has of your customers. Start with one or two key sources, then add more over time.
</Tip>

## How to Add an Integration

1. Click **Integrations** in the sidebar
2. Click **Browse Catalog**
3. Select the integration you want to connect
4. Enter your credentials and click **Save**
5. Click **Introspect Schema** to let Humm learn the data structure

Most integrations take just a few minutes to set up. Once connected, Humm automatically discovers your tables, fields, and relationships.

Humm **cannot** modify, delete, or write data to your connected systems.
