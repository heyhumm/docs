GuideCX is a customer onboarding and project management platform designed for implementation teams. Connect Humm to search projects, milestones, tasks, and notes to understand customer implementation progress.

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `GUIDECX_SEARCH_PROJECTS` | Search projects with filtering by customer name, status, or custom properties |
| `GUIDECX_SEARCH_MILESTONES` | Search milestones with optional project filtering |
| `GUIDECX_SEARCH_TASKS` | Search tasks with filtering by project, name, or status |
| `GUIDECX_SEARCH_NOTES` | Search notes by project or task |
| `GUIDECX_LIST_USERS` | List all users in the workspace |

## Filter Behavior

### Case Sensitivity

All GuideCX filters are **case-sensitive**. If no results are returned, verify the exact casing:

```
# These are all different searches:
customerName = "Acme"
customerName = "acme"
customerName = "ACME"
```

**Tip:** Run a broad search first (no filters, limit=10) to see actual customer and project names, then refine with correct casing.

### Partial Matching with `like:` Prefix

Text filters (`customerName`, `name`) automatically use GuideCX's `like:` prefix for partial matching:

```
# Searching for customerName = "Acme" matches:
- "Acme Corp"
- "Acme Manufacturing, Inc."
- "The Acme Company"

# But NOT (wrong case):
- "acme corp"
- "ACME CORP"
```

## Custom Property Filtering

Projects can have custom properties (e.g., HubSpot Company ID, Salesforce Account ID). Use `propsFilter` to filter by these values.

### Discovering Custom Properties

First, search projects without filters to inspect the `properties` object:

```
GUIDECX_SEARCH_PROJECTS(limit=10)

# Response includes:
{
  "projects": [{
    "name": "Acme Implementation",
    "properties": {
      "hubspotCompanyId": "12345",
      "salesforceAccountId": "001ABC123",
      "region": "EMEA"
    }
  }]
}
```

### Filtering by Custom Properties

Once you know the property name, use `propsFilter`:

```
GUIDECX_SEARCH_PROJECTS(
  propsFilter = {
    "name": "hubspotCompanyId",
    "value": "12345"
  }
)
```

This maps to GuideCX's `props[hubspotCompanyId]=12345` query syntax.

## Status Values

### Project Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ON_TIME` | Project is on schedule |
| `LATE` | Project is behind schedule |
| `ON_HOLD` | Project is paused |
| `DONE` | Project is complete |
| `NON_RESPONSIVE` | Customer is not responding |
| `CANCELLED` | Project has been cancelled |

### Task Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `NOT_STARTED` | Task has not begun |
| `WORKING_ON_IT` | Task is in progress |
| `DONE` | Task is complete |
| `STUCK` | Task is blocked |
| `SIGN_OFF` | Task awaiting sign-off |
| `NOT_APPLICABLE` | Task does not apply |
| `NOT_SCHEDULED` | Task has no scheduled date |
| `SCHEDULED` | Task is scheduled |
