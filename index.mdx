## What is Humm?

Humm is an analytics platform built specifically for Customer Success, Post-Sales, Growth Managers, and CX teams. It connects to your existing data sources and apps, letting you analyze customer health, spot risks, and find opportunities—all through simple, natural language questions.

Think of Humm as having an analyst on your team who already knows your business, understands your data, and is available whenever you need answers.

## Core Concepts

Understanding these five concepts will help you get the most out of Humm.

### Threads

Threads are conversations with Humm. Each thread captures a back-and-forth dialogue where you ask questions and Humm provides answers.

When you ask a question, Humm shows you:
- **What it's doing** — A reasoning section that shows the steps Humm takes to find your answer
- **The answer** — A formatted response that may include text, charts, tables, and recommendations

You can ask follow-up questions in the same thread to dig deeper. Threads are saved automatically, so you can return to past analyses anytime.

### Commands

Commands are reusable prompts that save you time on repetitive work. Instead of typing out the same detailed question each time, you create a Command once and run it whenever you need it.

**Common uses for Commands:**
- QBR preparation for a specific account
- Weekly portfolio health reviews
- New customer onboarding checklists
- Churn risk assessments

Commands turn hours of meeting prep into minutes. You can create Commands for yourself or share them with your team.

### Memories

Memories are how Humm learns and gets smarter over time. As you use Humm, it automatically extracts important knowledge from your conversations—things like business definitions, data relationships, and organizational context.

**Examples of Memories:**
- "The csm_owner field determines account ownership"
- "CSAT and resolution time determine support quality"
- "Link HubSpot to Pendo via the account_id property"

Memories are reviewed before being applied, so you stay in control of what Humm learns. Over time, this tribal knowledge makes Humm's answers more accurate and relevant to your specific business.

### Integrations

Integrations connect Humm to your data sources. The more integrations you set up, the more complete picture Humm has of your customers.

**Types of integrations:**
- **Databases** — Snowflake, BigQuery, PostgreSQL, and others for your core business data
- **CRM systems** — Salesforce, HubSpot, Attio for customer and deal information
- **Product analytics** — Mixpanel, Pendo, PostHog for usage data
- **Support tools** — Intercom, ChurnZero for customer interactions
- **Project management** — Jira, Linear for tracking and planning

Setting up an integration takes just a few minutes. Once connected, Humm automatically discovers your data structure.

### Ontology

The ontology is Humm's understanding of your business. It maps out the key entities in your world (like Customers, Accounts, Products) and how they relate to each other.

**What the ontology includes:**
- **Business entities** — The core concepts in your business and their definitions
- **Relationships** — How entities connect (e.g., Accounts have Users, Users generate Events)
- **Key metrics** — Important KPIs like Monthly Recurring Revenue, churn rate, NPS
- **Business glossary** — Definitions specific to your organization

Humm generates the ontology automatically from your integrations, but you can refine it to match exactly how your team thinks about the business. A well-tuned ontology means more accurate answers.
